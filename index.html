          <p>A little about me. My name is Suzanne, or Sue. I am currently in the final semester of my undergraduate degree (hurray!). I play hockey and have two dogs. I am the co-chair of the anthropology student union at my university. I always wanted to be a forensic anthropologist-thank you Bones, however inaccurate-until a professor explained how few forensic anthropologists there were in Canada, (she was the consulting forensic anthropologist for the Vancouver Island). Needless to say, my hopes were slightly dashed. Until, I took a seminar in culture anthropology and ‘found my calling’ or some such cliché phrase. I love museums. I am fascinated by people and ‘culture.’ My main focus is community-based and ethnographic research (aka cultural anthropology). Last semester, I completed the honours program, writing my essay on the perceptions of repatriation in anthropology literature (with what I’ve learned so far, I wish I took this class before/during the honours program). I took this class (Digital Archaeology: Virtual Heritage & Practice in the 21st Century) for a few reasons:</br>I needed another method and theory class to graduate. </br>It looked like a class that had genuine applicable job skills (somewhat of a rarity). </br> I am interested in digital archives and digital exhibits and the ethics surrounding them. </br>My digital skills are(were?) lacking, to say the least. </br>We develop a portfolio to showcase projects and skill development. </p>

                  <h3>Critical Review of Website</h3>
                  <p><em>Why did you design the website the way you did?</em> </br> As someone who never built a website before, I wanted my website to be as simple as possible. When it comes to social media, excluding some Facebook proficiency, I am most familiar with food blogs. As such, when it came to designing my website, I found a one-page website template that met my requirements, needed little(ish) alterations, and had a colour scheme I enjoyed. My idea was to set up the website similar to a blog, where I could talk about how each project was working out. I like the informality and personal approach to blogs. How it is one person’s experiences and opinions. In food blogs the person walks you through the meal and how it turns out, why they wanted to cook and share with their audience. I will attempt to do the same, in the context of ‘learning’ digital archaeology. </br><em>What went wrong? </em></br>Though there were no catastrophic failures with my website (so far), a few things that went wrong include the photos chosen to replace the template ones were not entirely compatible. I forgot to commit changes before closing my browser once or twice and had to redo many things. I never did figured out how to scale down the size of my images. Overall, my website is very simple with minimal (no) bells or whistles. </br><em>How would you address these issues in future? </em></br>Spending more time learning to code and reviewing tutorials would help to address some of the problems I was having. Perhaps more trips to Office Hours would have also helped. More time learning code would have also provided me further abilities to add more ‘bells and whistles’. Over time I would like to change the photos selected for the projects section to something more applicable. However, I need to know what those project will be first. </br><em>What do you think is successful about the project? Why? </em></br>I managed to actually create a website. The links to ‘projects’ and social media work. I consider that a success. For someone who had no previous knowledge or skills of coding or technology in general, I am fairly pleased with the outcome of my website thus far. It can only get better from here! </p>

                  <h3>Voyant</h3>
                  <p>This platform is incredibly useful for analysing and interpreting large amounts of text data. I wish I had known about this software before; it could have helped tremendously for previous assignments. Voyant is fairly easy to use and the visualizations are easy understand. All you need to do is enter or upload text documents and the program gives you a summary of the text and creates word frequency lists, frequency distribution plots, word clouds and other visualization tools based on the data entered. This software is applicable to anthropology and archaeology because it allows you to analysis digital texts for word frequencies, correlations and associations between words. To try it out, I first uploaded Dr. Seuss’s ‘Green Eggs and Ham,’ there were many correlations between many words. To get a better idea of how Voyant worked, I uploaded my honours essay. My document had 9,959 words, 1,992 unique word forms, and the most frequent words were repatriation (177); article/s (112) American (75); and cultural (67). The visualization tools I preferred were the TextualArc, Knots, and TermsBerry. I found them to present the data and correlations between words very effectively and visually pleasing. You can also export a ULR of a visualization tool or embeddable a tool to another platform. With some of the visualization tools, the amount of words in your document does affect their appearance. Some tools are better than others, and I have not completely figured out how to read all the various graphs, however, this platform is incredibly useful, I will use it again and would recommend this to anyone who wanted to analysis or visualize digital texts.</p>

                  <h5>Recognized Residential Schools on Vancouver Island, </br> British Columbia, </br> Canada </h5>
                  <p class="text-justify">This project was inspired by the ‘Bones of our Past’ Heritage Jam challenge and the Indigenous Studies course I am currently taking. When I first thought about the theme ‘Bones of our Past,’ I instantly thought of Canada’s history of colonization and residential schools, and how these are the bones of Canada's past. I wanted to create a project that acknowledged and addressed Canada’s history of residential schools, specifically looking at the recognized* schools located on Vancouver Island (and surrounding islands). This project consists of a brief overview of residential schools, a timeline to visualize the duration of these schools being open, and an interactive map locating where and when these schools were operational.  *There are other schools that have not been officially recognized as being residential schools.</p>
                  <h5>Canada’s Residential School History</h5>
                  <p class="text-justify">Between 1879 and 1996 upwards of 150,000 First Nation, Inuit and Métis children were forcibly removed from their families and communities and placed into Indian Industrial Schools (residential schools). The goal of the residential school system was to educate and assimilate Indigenous children into Christian, Euro-Canadian cultural norms and knowledge bases. </br></br> The majority of the schools were federally funded and run by various Christian churches. From 1920 to 1948, attendance was compulsory for Indigenous children between the ages of 4 and 16. There were 139 federally funded Indian residential schools in Canada, 18 of which could be found in BC, 6 of those 18 on Vancouver Island. </br></br> In these residential schools, children were forbidden to speak their native languages, were taught that their cultures were inferior and that they themselves were worthless. They suffered various sorts of abuse: physical, emotional, sexual, psychological, and spiritual. </br></br> Recent research reveals that more than 6,000 children died in these schools— of tuberculosis and Spanish flu, in fires, by drowning or exposure while fleeing, and by suicide. Recently, scholars have proven that the federal government conducted nutritional experimentation on at least 1,300 Indigenous people, most of them hungry children in 6 different residential schools across Canada, including the school in Port Alberni. </br></br> The generations who endured such trauma in childhood were silenced for decades by the fear and shame instilled in them by cruel treatment and constant deprivation. This led to a fundamental breakdown of communities, and alienated the children from their families and cultural traditions. For many children and grandchildren of survivors, intergenerational impacts continue to be experienced to this day. Residential schools did more than just destroy ties to culture and land; the forced separation of Indigenous children also left them without nurturing families, or the knowledge and skills to interact with and raise their own families. </p>

                  <p><em>What went wrong?</em> </br> This assignment caused me more grief than the last. There were many learning curves to overcome. When I started to add iframes for the portfolio 2 project, my website repeatedly crashed, failed to load, or took forever to load. It was incredibly frustrating. For a bit of time my website displayed the 404 page not found message, I still don’t know what happened or how I fixed it. Learning mapping software was incredibly difficult, until I found MapHub. Initially, my embedded map would not display on my webpage and the size formatting of my timeline is slightly compressed, likely due to being in the size-restricted project section. </br> <em> How would you address these issues in future? </em> </br> Creating a whole new website to house my portfolio 2 project would have solved many of my issues. However, I was able to address most of the issues I came across. With some help in office hours and google. At first, I added the portfolio 2 project to the main page of my website, in hopes that would work for the iframe. It did not. I tried removing all the iframes from my website, in hopes it would work/load without them. Website still would not fully load. Next, I played around with moving the iframes from the main page of the website into the project grid section. At some point, after countless refreshes, my website fully loaded and all my visualizations appeared. It was a programming miracle, they eventually work. I am convinced there are programming Keebler elves. I found the fix for getting my map to display in a MapHub forum. It was embarrassingly simple, change the map from private to public. The formatting issue of the timeline was solved by adjusting the size of the webpage.</br> <em> What do you think is successful about the project? Why?</em> </br>As with the website (portfolio 1), I was eventually successful in creating both an interactive map and timeline of the recognized residential schools on Vancouver Island. I think this project is successful because it briefly discussion some of the history of residential schools in Canada and brings it closer to home with the visuals of the timeline and map of Vancouver Island. It also displays the duration in which these schools were operational which I think can be surprising for some people.</br> <em> How do you measure success in digital archaeology?</em> </br>A successful digital archaeology project should be engaging for people (target audiences) and get them to consider things in new or different ways. Which can be done by developing user friendly platforms that are easily accessible to people with minimal background in the subject matter. Digital archaeology projects should appropriately* preserve data and disseminate findings. *Considering the type of data you have, where it is from, who it involves, ext... A successful digital archaeology project should start a dialogue concerning the past, previous ways of conducting research, and who owns ‘heritage.’</p>

                  <h3>JuxtaposeJS</h3>
                  <p>This platform compares image frames and fairly easy to use. This platform was designed to highlight then/now stories that can explain slow changes over time (growth of a city skyline, regrowth of a forest, etc.) or before/after stories that show the impact of single dramatic events (natural disasters, protests, wars, etc.). In an archaeological context, it can be used to highlight changes over time to sites, landscapes, and architectures. I chose to compare two aerial photographs of the University of Victoria campus from 1970 and 1992. The landscape change is incredibly dramatic!</p>
